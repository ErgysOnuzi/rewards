 Improve Verification Process Beyond Basic Stake ID Entry:
	•  Require users to place a specific, low-risk bet on Stake.com (e.g., wager a minimal amount like $0.01 in a designated coin or game to avoid real loss).
	•  Instruct users to submit the unique bet ID generated by Stake after placing the bet.
	•  Manually (or automate via API if possible) verify the bet ID against Stake’s data to confirm it matches the user’s claimed Stake ID and profile.
	•  If verification fails (e.g., mismatched IDs), prompt for retry or flag for admin review.
•  Incorporate Profile Visibility Checks for Ownership Confirmation:
	•  During verification, query if the user’s Stake profile is public (not hidden).
	•  If public, pull and display the associated username or display name in the verification UI to let the user confirm it’s theirs.
	•  If hidden, rely solely on the bet ID method and note in UI that hidden profiles require extra steps for security.
•  Implement Full User Account Creation on LukeRewards.com:
	•  After successful verification, guide users to create a dedicated account: Prompt for a unique email (their own, not site-generated) and a strong password.
	•  Link the new account directly to the verified Stake ID in the backend (e.g., store in database with encryption).
	•  Ensure accounts grant private access to personal stats, spins, and rewards— no public viewing to avoid “pocket watching.”
	•  Add backend logic to prevent duplicate accounts (e.g., one per Stake ID).
•  Add Security Disclaimer During Account Setup:
	•  Display a prominent, non-skippable disclaimer popup or text: “IMPORTANT: Do NOT use the same password as your Stake login. Using the same credentials could compromise your security.”
	•  Include tips like enabling 2FA if your site supports it, or recommending password managers.
•  Handle Email Linking Without Building a Custom Email Service:
	•  Use the user’s provided email for account recovery, notifications, and verification (e.g., send a confirmation link via external SMTP like Google/Gmail API if integrated).
	•  Do not allow users to create emails on your domain—stick to linking existing ones to keep it simple and avoid mail server overhead.
	•  For privacy, store emails hashed or encrypted; only use for essential functions like password resets.
•  Set Up Verification Mode (Manual vs. Automated):
	•  Start with manual verification for bet IDs (e.g., admin dashboard to check submissions) to test reliability.
	•  Plan for automation: If Stake API access is available, script checks; otherwise, use web scraping or user-submitted screenshots as fallback (but discourage due to forgery risks).
	•  Test the flow end-to-end with 3-5 dummy users: Simulate bet placement, ID submission, account creation, and stats access.
	•  Keep it straightforward—aim for under 5 minutes per user; if too complex, simplify by removing optional steps.
•  Enforce Privacy and Data Handling Best Practices:
	•  Design the system as a “private phone book”: Stats and details are only accessible post-login; no public directories or searchable user lists.
	•  Add terms in UI: “Your data is private and only used for rewards tracking. We do not share with third parties except as required for verification.”
	•  Log verifications for auditing but anonymize where possible to comply with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR if international users).
Once this is implemented, re-test the entire user onboarding flow to ensure it integrates smoothly with the now-completed UI, data, rewards, and testing elements.
